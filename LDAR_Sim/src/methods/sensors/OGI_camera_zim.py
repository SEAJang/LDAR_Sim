    """ OGI camera method based on Zimmerlie 2020 DOI 10.1021/acs.est.0c01285
        uses power function as shown in figure 2 to calculate probability of
        detection using leak size and  two mdl parameters are set based on which
        are based on camera crew experience.

    Args:
        site (site obj): Site in which crew is working at
        covered_leaks (list): list of leak objects that can be detected by the crew
        covered_equipment_rates (list): list of equipment leak rates that can be
                                        detected by the crew
        covered_site_rate (float): total site emissions from leaks that are observable
                                    from a crew
        site_rate (float): total site emissions from leaks all leaks at site
        venting (float): total site emissions from venting
        equipment_rates (list): list of equipment leak rates for each equipment group

    Returns:
        site report (dict):
                site  (site obj): same as input
                leaks_present (list): same as covered leaks input
                site_true_rate (float): same as site_rate
                site_measured_rate (float): total emis from all leaks measured
                equip_measured_rates (list): total of all leaks measured for each equip group
                venting (float): same as input
                found_leak (boolean): Did the crew find at least one leak at the site
